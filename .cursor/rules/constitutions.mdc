# Project Constitution

This is a platform-style desktop developer tool, not a feature collection.

Modules must be:
- dynamically registered
- extensible
- never hard-coded

UI must not contain any platform-specific logic.
All Android / iOS / HarmonyOS differences must be isolated via an Adapter layer.

The interaction model follows DevToys:
- left-side module navigation
- right-side working panel

The final application must be plug-and-play:
- no manual environment setup
- no manual dependency installation
- usable immediately after install

UI styling and icons must follow:
- use Tailwind CSS for visual styling
- use Iconify for icons

AI must not:
- introduce features not defined in the PRD
- hard-code module lists or routes
- add cloud, account, or remote capabilities
